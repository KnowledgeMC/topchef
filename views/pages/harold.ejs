      <span style="font-weight:bold"> Name: </span>Harold Dieterle<br>
      <span style="font-weight:bold"> Bio: </span> Harold Dieterle was the winning chef of Top Chef season 1.
      Harold was a 1997 graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and his professional career began at
      Della Femina in the Hamptons for two years. That was followed by three years at Red Bar and two years
      at 1770 House, both in New York City. For almost five years, he was a sous-chef at The Harrison restaurant in New York.
      In October 2005, Dieterle competed in and won the first season of Top Chef. Following his win on the series,
      he left The Harrison in early 2006 to plan the opening of his own restaurant. His first restaurant, Perilla,
      opened in May 2007 in New York City. In 2010 he opened Kin Shop, a Thai restaurant. Most recently, he opened
      The Marrow in New York City. The food at The Marrow was a mashup of Italian and German cuisine and an ode to
      Dieterle's heritage. The Marrow closed its doors in 2014 after less than two years. In late 2015, Dieterle
      closed his two remaining restaurants, Kin Shop and Perilla. Dieterle said he was taking a leave from the
      restaurant and hospitality business. In a positive 2010 review of Kin Shop in the magazine New York,
      food critic Adam Platt called Dieterle "the original (and easily most talented) winner" of Top Chef.

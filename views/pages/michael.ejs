      <span style="font-weight:bold"> Name: </span>Michael Voltaggio<br><br>
      <span style="font-weight:bold"> Bio: </span>Voltaggio did not have the money to attend culinary school. Instead, he did a long apprenticeship
      in The Greenbrier's prestigious culinary apprenticeship program. Michael completed his Greenbrier apprenticeship under Certified Master Chef
      Peter Timmins at the age of 21. He later held jobs at the Ritz Carlton Hotel Naples, Florida under chef Peter Timmins and Charlie Palmer's
      Dry Creek Kitchen in Healdsburg. During his tenure as Chef de Cuisine at The Bazaar by Jose Andres, the restaurant was nominated for
      the James Beard Foundation Award for Best New Restaurant in 2008. Voltaggio was the Chef de Cuisine at The Dining Room, Langham Huntington
      Hotel & Spa in Pasadena, which received several culinary awards, including the AAA Five Diamond Award, the Mobil Five-Star Award,
      and a Michelin Star, one of the few held by restaurants in the US. Voltaggio left The Dining Room in 2010 and announced plans to
      open his own restaurant in West Hollywood, CA, in a space owned by former Hollywood superagent Michael Ovitz. After several delays, the
      highly successful ink. opened on September 21, 2011. Voltaggio's goal with the restaurant was to create what he called "modern Los Angeles
      cuisine." The restaurant seats 60 in the dining room with a private room that can accommodate an additional 10 guests.
      It was named America's best new restaurant by GQ Magazine in March 2012. While publicly developing and readying ink. for its highly
      anticipated debut, Voltaggio was quietly planning a smaller restaurant around the corner, a sandwich shop called ink.sack.
      Voltaggio designed and built the shop himself and surprised the culinary world when he opened the small restaurant with little notice
      or fanfare on August 11, 2011. Voltaggio appeared in September, 2010 on the finale of season seven of Top Chef and as a guest judge in Season 3 of Top Chef Canada.
